# DBMS-Assignments-Biz-School

This repo contains assignments done during the Database Management class. The course gave me an overview about databases, different operations that can be done on databases, how data gets stored in these databases, how one can create, read, update or delete data from these databases. 

The repo only consists of the SQL assignments completed. The other assignments included operations done before the creation of a database. This includes creating an ER diagram, designing physical and logical schemas and setting permissions according to the business requirements stated. The last assignment helped me in learning the various forms of normalizations in databases.
